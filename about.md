  Dear reader. I hope these letters find you well...   
</p>

I am often exposed to the idea that work and life are separated somehow and prone in separation to lose balance, fall over. 
Here then is some evidence of life, set apart from work, as a counterweight of sorts. Maybe it is scaffolding balanced against 
the weight of ambition, compensation. Maybe it is something more. 

Most of these letters focus on life events:

* Gatherings 
* Happenings 
* Travels 

Common topics include weddings, funerals, opinions, and memories.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://rtuggle.github.io/life_blog/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tugglery).

Thanks for reading!
