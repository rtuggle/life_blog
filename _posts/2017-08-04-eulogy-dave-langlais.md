In one of the readings in the missal in front of you the Book of Kings tells the story of Solomon, the king who concerned himself first and foremost with his people, who was blessed with a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like him, nor will there ever be. 

So I guess this is what we know about good men: they are beloved, they are unique. Certainly, we know that Dave Langlais was one-of-a-kind. He was funny, he was wise, and he was stubborn – I mean really a pain sometimes, just ask Terry. But we’ll get to that. 

First, Dave was funny, the star of many dinner parties, and the author of gags that made us snort until water poured from our noses. His comedic sensibility was well suited to the variety show format, parades of guests and jokey banter from the hosts. He was particularly fond of the comedy duo, pairing up with a buddy to make us laugh. A few of these acts he developed for decades, building up characters and in-jokes. 

The typical party greeting between Dave and frequent collaborator Roger Sippl defines the style, both of them adopting an arch affectation of country-club manners. 

"Well hello, Roger." 

"Why, hello David, how are you?"

"I’m swell thanks, and you?"

"Oh I’m just tops"

From there they’d traverse dozens of bits and routines. Among them, dueling impressions of mildly offensive tv characters turned internet memes. 

"My name is the Craw" 

"The Craw?"

"No, no, Mr. Smart not the Craw... the Craw"

At other times Dave happily played the gullible foil to Roger’s know-it-all professor. Among my favorites, the "how do it know" routine. 

"Now David, among food storage containers, the Thermos really is quite impressive."

"I’ll say, sometimes it’s hot, sometimes it’s cold. How do it know? How do it know?"

Depending on the night, Dave might moonlight with other collaborators, switching up the roles to better suit their styles. 

"Now Margaret there’s no reason to get testy."

"You know what I like about you David? Not a god…"

Actually I shouldn’t reenact the rest of that bit here, but ask Maggie about it. 

Dave loved all his collaborators, spanning back to his time with the Boyz in high school. His favorites, of course, were his kids. With them he mostly played it straight, affecting a bemused “keep thinking Butch, that’s what you’re good at” attitude. But his pride showed through. 

When John David was about six years old he started to tell his first joke. It’s about a golfer that keeps missing shots around the course and every time he misses, he says “Darn it, I missed.” (That’s actually the church pulpit version of the joke, but you get the idea: the golfer misses and swears "Darn it, I missed"). Then, out on the 18th tee, the golfer takes a big swing, falls over, and before he can swear again, the skies open up, lightning strikes a nearby tree, and the voice of god booms:  "Darn it, I missed." 

Like any six year old learning a new skill John made a total mess of this joke. "Then god said, no I mean the golfer, no wait there was lightening…" But every time John told it, Dave looked on with a satisfied smile. He never told that joke himself but I’m sure he cherished it, he was so pleased to watch his kids learn to laugh like him. 

Dave’s talents extended beyond comedy, and we all know he played serious roles as well, among them the advisor and guide. He stood before many gatherings as I stand before you today, trying to make sense of the incomprehensible, trying to share wisdom in a time of need.  

When he and Terry sent me off to Washington and out into the world, Dave pulled me aside and said:

"You know Ry, you’re going to learn that life is both much worse and much better than you think."

And when he said it I teased him like a teenage know-it-all for the Zen profundity of the thing. "Oh yeah, I guess that’s like the sound of one hand clapping, huh?" But after I grew up a bit I did learn, I learned what it’s like to be entrenched in some horrible argument suddenly interrupted by some small act of kindness, or to be subjected to the stress of an impossible deadline and unexpectedly find relief in a moment of peace and clarity at home, or to be standing before you now in shock and despair and yet somehow recall my daughters sitting with their Grandpa Dave laughing uncontrollably at the follies of Moe Buckets. It’s all so much worse and so much better than I ever thought. And he wanted me to know that he understood this too. 

So how? How did Dave find this wisdom, how did he manage to make us laugh? I think if we’re honest we have to admit that he did it in part by being stubborn, and contrary and endlessly insistent. Dave would argue with his own reflection if it looked at him sideways. He would argue that four of the five greatest rock albums of all time were composed by Jimmy Buffet. He would argue that crosswalks were for communists. He would argue that bacon was a food group. He would argue that Newt Gingrich wasn’t so bad. 

Now much of this was playful and some of it was wrong, but all of it was unwavering. Dave persisted and persisted. That this could be frustrating at times was evident in Terry’s voice: David <exasperated>, David <groan>, David <startled>. 

But there were also times when we needed his persistence to set us straight. Terry says she never would have married the man if he weren’t so dogged and we’ve all seen glimpses of what she means. When I was a kid and I came to stay with Dave and Terry in the summers, they would take me to Great America, which was a far cry from Disneyland in Dave’s eyes but the rides were ok. After one of these trips, days spent on roller coasters, they tucked me into their guest bedroom while a dinner party cleaned up in the hall. But I couldn’t sleep. 

When I closed my eyes I’d feel the swooping plunging sensations of the roller coasters again like the guest bed was careening down the rails, my stomach was turning and before long I cried out for help. Terry came to soothe me, oh sweetie, she patted my back and so forth. But then I’d close my eyes and again the plunging until I got pretty worked up. After an hour, unable to sleep and sincerely tormented, I’m sobbing loudly when Dave walks in. 

"Hey pal, what’s the matter?"

"I ca-ca-ca-can’t sleep." 

"Aw jeez, that’s too bad, how come?" 

"When I ca-ca-ca-close my eyes I feel sick." 

"Oh, well, that’s your problem right there. You know what you should do, you should sleep with your eyes open." 

"I ca-ca-ca-can’t sleep with my eyes open! That’s impossible!" 

"Aw, sure you can. Sure you can."

That "sure you can" was Dave’s persistent way of insisting on the opposite of what I’d always known to be true: that we close our eyes, and go to sleep. 

At that point I resolved to stare at the ceiling until morning just to show my obstinate uncle how wrong he was. I think I managed to stay awake for 10 minutes. I vaguely remember him saying "Goodnight pal… Love you" as I drifted off to sleep.

So this is the man—funny, wise, and stubborn—thinking first and foremost of his people, such that there will never have been anyone like him, nor will there ever be. This is the man that my dear Aunt Terry and my dear cousins John and Kathleen are grieving. The man we are all grieving. 

When I arrived to Terry’s bedside late at night last week she said "every time I close my eyes it all starts over again… I don’t know what I’m going to do." And she is completely heartbroken. So that night in the dark I am sobbing again and I think of myself talking to Dave, and I’m thinking we can’t, we can’t do this, we can’t cope, we can’t remember everything that was good about this man and somehow carry it on. But then Dave’s voice insists: "sure you can, sure you can."
