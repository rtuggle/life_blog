title: Eulogy - Marge Leahy
---
*Cathedral Ave, Washington, District of Columbia*

Today we remember Marge. It’s her birthday so we’ll remember her the way she’d want to be remembered: elegant in her party attire, smiling mischievously, whispering quite loudly that she hopes we don’t make a mess of the speech, singing quite loudly over any of the quiet bits.  Perhaps one of you might even be willing to bellow out a misquoted stanza from Charlie Chaplin’s Smile at some point to continue the tradition. Just wait until we’re least expecting it and sing like you want the whole damn world to hear you.  

That’s all part of the show. The Marge and Maggie show. They played dozens of cities at all the finest venues on both sides of the Atlantic. For many years the scene was Fulton Street, just a few blocks up. The dining room is glowing and the table is done up with candles and tiny pumpkins. 

Maggie sits down at the head of the table and says: 

Well I had a special little talk with the Gardner today. He tells me Margie’s been harassing the crew again. 

Marge is shocked:

Who me? I’m just a sweet little old lady. 

She folds her hand like a nun and then bursts into laughter. Maggie presses on:    

He said you wouldn’t let them rake?

Marge is firm:

Oh no. Maggie. No.  I asked the man, once he finished with that noisy thing of his, very politely I said, sir, sir, look at all these little leaves that are still on the ground, don’t you want to rake those up? Do you know what this person told me Maggie? He told me that he didn’t have a rake. So I told him, you’re no Gardner, you’re just a mower and a blower. 

She bursts into laughter again. Maggie laughs once, turns to the rest of the table and says: 

Anyway, I get home there’s mother in her slippers out on the lawn raking away like she’s loony. 

Now everyone’s laughing and Marge whispers loudly to no one in particular: 

She’s going to kill me for my money. I’m very wealthy you know.  

Marge had great timing, good looks, and a great big voice. She was entertaining. But she was something more than that too, something similar to the theatre. Her wit always poking at the frailties and missed chances, the delusions and tragic flaws: greed, pride, vanity. He’s still got his first communion money. She’s too bossy that one. I’ve been doing a study of the first person singular and that man wins the prize for most mentions of I and me in a single sentence. You’re not up for saint hood darling.

Marge loved all the flaws that make us interesting, real. Another night in Fulton Street and the show has taken a fictional turn. Maggie is introducing the assembled guests to her grandfather, the tall German man with hound whose life size portrait hangs in the dining room. 

Maggie says mock wistfully:

He was a great hunter. 

And one of the guests, far too serious, says with feeling: 

Oh Marge, what was he like?

Marge’s face turns serious for a moment and she says before bursting into laughter: 

He was a drunk. And the dog hated him too. 

In our flaws, Marge found humor, the hope of redemption; she might even have called it grace. And sometimes it was hard. In my case, she saw all too clearly the young man overeager for approval and the later the secret ambitions and tiny disappointments. You’re flawed, she said, and the truth hurt. But we love you. You’re flawed but we love you. You’ve enriched our lives darling.  

Marge had impressive range as a performer. Her secret was her willingness to stare deep into the dark well that is the source of all great literature and elect to pour herself a third glass. Thus prepared she could sing through the centuries, anything from the lilting old English of Chaucer to the brassy roar of Ethel Merman.

Suddenly and mysteriously she recites:

>Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote
>The droghte of March hath perced to the roote
>And bathed every veyne in swich licour,
>Of which vertu engendred is the flour.
	
And then her eyes go a bit distant and just as suddenly, she sings:

>Let me entertain you and we’ll have a real good time, yes sir, 
>we’ll have a real good time

Marge’s special genius was that she recognized our place in a grand and ancient tradition. She assured us that we belonged among that great cast of flawed characters stretching from Gypsy Rose all the way back to the Canterbury Tales. 

Marge is now firmly fixed in that tradition: the descendent of a long line of Irish scrub women, scrubbing obsessively at granite counter tops in an Yves St Laurent pantsuit; the child of the depression, dining at Café Milano with Washington’s power elite; the beauty queen from Minneapolis who never worked a day in her life, arriving at the station house at age 45 and building a career with all the blue collar cops; the author of emphatic and colorful blasphemies, baptizing her grandchild in the kitchen sink; the special talent who might in different times have been touched by fame, still smiling in her later years with bright plans to be a journalist when she grew up; the great wit, the marvelous wit, the wit that lives now in us, the wit that will never succumb not even to the cruelest disease, the wit that revealed our flaws and showed the grace of love.

Today we remember Marge: you’ve enriched our lives darling; you know we love you.
